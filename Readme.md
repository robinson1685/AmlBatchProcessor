Outline and Plan
Project Structure:

Application Layer: Contains business logic and application services.
Domain Layer: Holds the domain entities, enums, exceptions, interfaces, types, and logic specific to the domain language.
Infrastructure Layer: Implements persistence logic, external services integration (e.g., API clients), and any other infrastructure-related tasks.
Worker Layer: A background service that will continuously run, looking for files to process, extract data, transform, call APIs, and save results to the database.
Technologies and Packages:

.NET Core 6 or .NET 7: Use the latest version for the most current features and improvements.
Entity Framework Core: For ORM to interact with the MSSQL database.
Serilog or NLog: For sophisticated logging.
HttpClientFactory: For API calls.
Hangfire, Quartz.NET, or .NET Core Worker Service: For background processing.
Automapper: For object-to-object mapping.
FluentValidation: For validation rules.
Implementation Steps:

Step 1: Project Setup

Create the solution structure with the four layers (Application, Domain, Infrastructure, Worker).
Set up dependency injection in the Worker Layer, configuring services for the application.
Step 2: Domain Layer

Define domain models representing the data structure.
Implement interfaces for repositories and services.
Step 3: Application Layer

Implement services using domain interfaces.
Define DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and use Automapper to map between domain models and DTOs.
Step 4: Infrastructure Layer

Implement repository interfaces with Entity Framework Core.
Configure HttpClientFactory for external API calls.
Implement logging.
Step 5: Worker Layer

Set up a background service using .NET Core Worker Service, Hangfire, or Quartz.NET.
Implement the logic to monitor for new files, read and extract data, transform data to domain models, call external APIs, and save results to the database.
Step 6: Database and External API

Design the MSSQL database schema.
Implement API clients for external API calls using HttpClientFactory.
Step 7: Testing and Validation

Write unit and integration tests for critical components.
Use FluentValidation for validating domain models.
Step 8: Logging and Error Handling

Implement global error handling and logging strategies.
Deployment and Monitoring:

Dockerize the application for easy deployment.
Use application monitoring tools (like Application Insights) to monitor the application's health and performance.
